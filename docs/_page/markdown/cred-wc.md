# Webcomponents . org

WebComponents.org aims to make it easy to share, discover, and reuse web components. Web components is a standard created to empower developers to create new HTML tags such that `<my-new-button>` would be valid and able to be utilized across all browsers. It creates a framework agnostic way of composing and repurposing code.

## Specifications
Web components are based on four main specifications:

Custom Elements
The [Custom Elements specification](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/) lays the foundation for designing and using new types of DOM elements.

Shadow DOM
The [shadow DOM specification](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) defines how to use encapsulated style and markup in web components.

ES Modules
The [ES Modules specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-module-system) defines the inclusion and reuse of JS documents in a standards based, modular, performant way.

HTML Template
The [HTML template element specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element/) defines how to declare fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime.
