 * The ui5-input component allows the user to enter and edit numbers.

 * The text field can be editable or read-only (readonly property), and it can be enabled or disabled (enabled property).
 * To visualize semantic states, such as "error" or "warning", the valueState property is provided.
 * When the user makes changes to the text, the change event is fired, which enables you to react on any text change.
